# The Other Side

**The Other Side** is a psychological horror game developed for the fifth Game Jam organized by the student association **GameScholars** at Rey Juan Carlos University, with the theme **"You're going to fall."**. It's my fourth Game Jam participation, and my first one as a solo dev.
